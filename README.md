This data set uses neural networks (LSTM; using PyTorch) to predict BTC closing prices over time given historical trends. This is a difficult problem; after all, a lot can change in very little time and the assumption that the past is predictive of the future does not always hold. But I am completing this based on data until early October 2024.  Obviously with the presidential elections coming up, various global tensions, and based on interest rates set by the Federal Reserve, much may change. But in the next few months, we'll have a real world test of how well this performed.
